Kafka is a database turned inside out, with distribution at heart.
High Availability and Linear Scalability.

Recommend 2.1, due to streaming join semantics (run-ahead, steady-state, protection on stream/table join)

Facts rather than Events
Messages in Kafka have three parts. Key, Value, Timestamp.
Trade-Offs and Knobs to twiddle (max.task.idle.ms for example)

Types of Data:

Mutable v Immutable
Durable v Ephemeral
In Flight v At Rest
